# My Application Overview

# Write a function called simple().
# Assign a different message to 5 variables
# And print each message.
def simple():
    """Months Of The Year"""
    message = 'january'
    print("message")
    message = 'february'
    print("message")
    message = 'march'
    print("message")
    message = 'april'
    print("message")
    message = 'may'
    print("message")


simple()

# write a function called simple2().
# assign a message to a variable, then print out the variable.
# change the message and assign it to the variable again, but after the first print statement.
# print the second message.
# do these steps 2 more times.
# you should have 4 messages assigned to the same variable and 4 print functions showing the results
def simple2():
    """These are the first of the months"""
    able = "January is the first month"
    print(able)
    able = "February is the second month"
    print(able)
    able = "March is the third month"
    print(able)
    able = "April is the forth month"
    print(able)


simple2()


# write a function called message that takes 1 argument.
# inside that function, write a print function that takes the argument.
